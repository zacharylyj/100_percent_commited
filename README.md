After generating your commit history with our tool, follow these steps to push it to your new GitHub repository. This will make your GitHub profile stand out with a rich history of contributions.

#### Create a New GitHub Repository

1. Go to GitHub and create a new repository. Note the repository name for the steps below.

2. **Navigate to the `real-repo-history` Directory**:

Open a terminal and change into the directory containing your newly generated commit history.

```bash
cd real-repo-history
```

#### Remove the Existing Git Remote

3. This step ensures that the local repository is no longer linked to the previous remote source.


```bash
git remote remove origin
```

#### Add Your New GitHub Repository as the Remote Origin:

4. Replace `<YOUR_NEW_REPO_NAME>` with the name of the GitHub repository you created. Ensure you use the correct URL format provided by GitHub.

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/<YOUR_NEW_REPO_NAME>.git
```

#### Rename Your Local Branch to Main (if it's not already named main)

5. Rename your local branch to `main`.

```bash
git branch -m main
```

#### Push Your Commit History to GitHub:

6. Finally, push your commit history to the new repository, setting the upstream branch to main.
